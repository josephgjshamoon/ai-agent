Assyria is an ancient Mesopotamian kingdom and empire that existed from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC until its collapse between 612 BC and 609 BC. It was located in the northern part of Mesopotamia, which corresponds to parts of present-day Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. Assyria is known for its powerful rulers, such as King Ashurbanipal, and its significant cultural achievements, including its extensive literature, art, and architecture. The Assyrians are also known for their military prowess and the establishment of one of the first known ancient empires.
